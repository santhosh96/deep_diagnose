## Introduction

### Background

Medical Science has seen a tremendous advancement in terms of diagnosis, medication as well as discovery of various new families of disorders and diseases. Diagnosis and treatment of such complicated diseases requires keen observation and highly experienced physicians and doctors. The field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are now being used most popularly as an assistant for such doctors in handling such complicated diseases. There are various scenarios, such as diagnosis of different types Cancers, where the AI are being used for faster detection. Which also in most times gives accurate results  

Medical Science has various other sub branches; one such field of medical science is the field of Dermatology. Dermatology is a field that mainly deals with the skin, nails, hair and its diseases. Skin being the most exposed part of the human body, encounters various kinds of fungi, bacteria, viruses etc. And have the tendency of being attacked by these small species. A skin disease called as Tinea is one such disease, that with traditional method medical diagnosis, requires long hours of diagnosis. And a higher proportion of time is devoted for observing the specimen under a microscope by an experienced doctor.

Our project basically aims at designing an algorithm, that would basically assist the process in two ways. Firstly, it would predict the presence of the diseases in the specimen in very less amount of time. And secondly, this would assist the doctors, in detection and diagnosis of the diseases, without requiring their presence for each and every case of Tinea being encountered.
